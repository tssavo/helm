# Tssavo's Helm Charts

For the uninitiated, [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is basically a templating solution for Kubernetes resource manifest.

All charts hosted here are catered for my own setup and might not be a perfect fit for everyone.
Please **do not** treat any charts as production ready.

## Usage

```s
$ helm repo add tssavo https://tssavo.github.io/helm/
$ helm repo update
```
